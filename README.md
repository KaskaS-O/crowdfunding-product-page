## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good challenge to practice more complex js. I had to deal with many different variants of activity on the website and different states of the project. There were some conflicts between using css and js to handle so many possible outcomes of the layout.

### Continued development

I think using React for this project would help to build cleaner code, allowing to inject html components to the website by js. Creating pledges with different states would shorten the code, especially in html file and probably simplify some handlers.
